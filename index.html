    g with your feet hip-width apart and your hands resting on your hips. Inhale as you lengthen your spine and exhale as you fold forward from your hips, bringing your hands to the ground or to the backs of your legs. If you have tight hamstrings, you can bend your knees slightly to ease into the stretch. Let your head hang heavy and relax your neck, and take several deep breaths in the pose before coming back up to standing. </p>

        <h3>12. Triangle (Trikonasana)</h3>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaechkahub/images/main/Triangle.png" alt="Triangle">
        <p>A standing yoga pose that stretches the hips, hamstrings, and spine, while also improving balance and stability. To come into the pose, start by standing with your feet about three to four feet apart and your arms out to the sides, palms facing down. Turn your left foot slightly inwards and your right foot out to the side, making sure your right heel is aligned with the arch of your left foot. Inhale as you reach your right arm up towards the ceiling, and exhale as you reach your right hand down towards your right ankle, shin, or a block, while at the same time extending your left arm up towards the ceiling. Keep your gaze directed towards your left hand and hold the pose for several breaths before coming back up to standing and repeating on the other side. </p>
